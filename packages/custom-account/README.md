# Permissionless.js Account Boilerplate Code

![Node Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-20.x-green)

permissionless.js is a TypeScript library built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh) for deploying and managing [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart accounts, interacting with bundlers and paymasters, and leveraging custom signers.
